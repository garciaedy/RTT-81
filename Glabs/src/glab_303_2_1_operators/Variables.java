		/* 	8. Write a program where you create three variables that represent products at a cafe.
		 * The products could be beverages like coffee, cappuccino, espresso, green tea, etc. Assign prices to each product.
		 *  Create two more variables called subtotal and totalSale and complete an “order” for three items of the first product,
		 *   four items of the second product, and two items of the third product. Add them all together to calculate the subtotal.
		 *   Create a constant called SALES_TAX and add sales tax to the subtotal to obtain the totalSale amount. Be sure to format
		 *   the results to two decimal places.*/
